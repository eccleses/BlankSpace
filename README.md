# BlankSpace
This library prints filler text in the standard out in Python3

It has 6 main functions:

BlankSpace.Run.Hello()to say hello

BlankSpace.Run.Goodbye() to say goodbye

BlankSpace.Run.Filler() to fill in a gap, with the first number in the brackets being fillers printed, then a comma and finally the category, 0 for random, 1 for Hardware, 2 for Things, 3 for (outdated and at this point, obscure) pop culture.

BlankSpace.Run.About() describe the purpose of functions, like I am doing now.

Use the BlankSpace.Run.infiniteMatrix() infinitely prints (meaningless) binary to the standard out.

Use the BlankSpace.Run.Matrix() prints the amount of binary digits put into the brackets after Matrix()
